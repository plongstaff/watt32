   NAME
         uname - print name of current UNIX system

   SYNOPSIS
         uname [-amnprsv]
         uname [-S system_name ]

   DESCRIPTION
         uname prints the current system name of the UNIX system to
         standard output.  It is mainly useful to determine which
         system one is using.  The options cause selected information
         returned by uname(2) and/or sysinfo(2) to be printed.
         Invoking uname with no options is equivalent to invoking uname
         -s.

         -a    Print all information.

         -m    Print the machine hardware name.

         -n    Print the node name (the node name is the name by which
               the system is known to a communications network).

         -p    Print the current host's processor type.

         -r    Print the operating system release.

         -s    Print the name of this implementation of the operating
               system (for example, UNIX System V).

         -v    Print the operating system version.

         -S    Set both the system name and the node name to
               system_name.  system_name is restricted to SYS_NMLN
               characters [see limits(4)].  Only a privileged user is
               allowed this capability.

               This option is provided only for compatibility reasons.
               It is recommended that you use setuname(1M) instead.
               setuname -s lets you change the system name
               independently of the node name.

               Be aware that if you change a node name, other software
               may break unexpectedly; so, it is good practice not to
               change a node name once it is set.  For example,
               networking software and application packages may save
               the node name of your system at the time the package is
               installed.  Therefore, each time you change the node
               name, you need to locate all the files where it has been
               saved and change its value.  See your System
               Administration guide for more information about setting
               up your work environment.

         The LC_CTYPE environment variable determines the processing of
         the output data.  [See LANG in environ(5).]
