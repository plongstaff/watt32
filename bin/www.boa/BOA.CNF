# Boa v0.95 configuration file
# File format has changed little from 0.90
# version changes are noted in the comments
#
# The Boa configuration file is parsed with a lex/yacc or flex/bison
# generated parser.  If it reports an error, the line number will be
# provided; it should be easy to spot.  The syntax of each of these
# rules is very simple, and they can occur in any order.  Where possible
# these directives mimic those of NCSA httpd 1.3; I saw no reason to 
# introduce gratuitous differences.

# The "ServerRoot" is not in this configuration file.  It can be compiled
# into the server (see defines.h) or specified on the command line with
# the -c option, for example:
#
# boa -c /usr/local/boa


# Port: The port Boa runs on. The default port for http servers is 80.

Port 80

#  User: The user-name and user's home directory (relative to UserDir below)
User guest      /guest
User webmaster  /webmaster


# ServerAdmin: The email address where server problems should be sent.
# Note: this is not currently used.

ServerAdmin webmaster@www.domain.com

# ErrorLog: The location of the error log file. If this does not start
# with /, it is considered relative to the server root.

ErrorLog ./logs/error.log

# AccessLog: The location of the access log file. If this does not
# start with /, it is considered relative to the server root.

AccessLog ./logs/access.log

# ServerName: the name of this server that should be sent back to 
# clients if different than that returned by gethostname -- often
# this is www.foo.bar.

ServerName dos-box

# DocumentRoot: The root directory of the HTML documents.

DocumentRoot /net/watt/bin/www.boa/docs

# UserDir: The name of the directory which is prepended onto a user's home
# directory if a ~user request is received.

#UserDir public_html
UserDir /net/watt/bin/www.boa/users

# DirectoryIndex: Name of the file to use as a pre-written HTML
# directory index.  Please MAKE AND USE THESE FILES.  On the
# fly creation of directory indexes can be _slow_.

DirectoryIndex index.htm

# DirectoryCache: Name of the directory to store directory caches
# DO NOT append a "/"
# Comment out if you don't want on-the-fly directory listings
# (new for 0.92)

DirectoryCache ./cache

# KeepAliveMax: Number of KeepAlive requests to allow per connection
# Comment out, or set to 0 to disable keepalive processing
# (new for 0.92 - experimental code)

#KeepAliveMax 10

# KeepAliveTimeout: seconds to wait before keepalive connection times out
# (new for 0.92 - experimental code)

#KeepAliveTimeout 10

# DefaultType: MIME type used if the file extension is unknown, or there
# is no file extension.

DefaultType text/plain

# AddType: adds types without editing mime.types
# Example: AddType type extension [extension ...]

# Uncomment the next line if you want .cgi files to execute from anywhere
#AddType application/x-httpd-cgi .cgi

# Redirect, Alias, and ScriptAlias all have the same semantics -- they
# match the beginning of a request and take appropriate action.  Use
# Redirect for other servers, Alias for the same server, and ScriptAlias
# to enable directories for script execution.

# Redirect allows you to tell clients about documents which used to exist in
# your server's namespace, but do not anymore. This allows you to tell the
# clients where to look for the relocated document.
# Example: Redirect /bar http://elsewhere/feh/bar

# Aliases: Aliases one path to another.
# Example: Alias /path1/bar /path2/foo

# ScriptAlias: Maps a virtual path to a directory for serving scripts
# Example: ScriptAlias /htbin/ /www/htbin/

#ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ /usr/local/boa/cgi-bin/
ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ /net/watt/bin/www.boa/perl/cgi/
