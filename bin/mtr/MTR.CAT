NAME
       mtr - a network diagnostic tool



SYNOPSIS
       mtr    [-hvrctglsni]   [--help]   [--version]   [--report]
       [--report-cycles COUNT]   [--curses]   [--split]   [--raw]
       [--no-dns]  [--gtk]  [--interval SECONDS] [--psize BYTES |
       -p BYTES] HOSTNAME [PACKETSIZE]



DESCRIPTION
       mtr combines the functionality of the traceroute and  ping
       programs in a single network diagnostic tool.


       As  mtr  starts,  it  investigates  the network connection
       between the host mtr  runs  on  and  HOSTNAME.   After  it
       determines  the  address  of  each network hop between the
       machines, it sends a sequence ICMP ECHO requests  to  each
       one  to determine the quality of the link to each machine.
       As it does this, it prints running statistics  about  each
       machine.



OPTIONS
       -h

       --help
              Print the summary of command line argument options.


       -v

       --version
              Print the installed version of mtr.


       -r

       --report
              This option puts mtr into  report  mode.   When  in
              this  mode,  mtr  will run for the number of cycles
              specified by the -c option, and then print  statis-
              tics and exit.

              This mode is useful for generating statistics about
              network quality.  Note that each  running  instance
              of  mtr  generates  a significant amount of network
              traffic.  Using mtr to measure the quality of  your
              network    may    result   in   decreased   network
              performance.


       -c COUNT

       --report-cycles COUNT
              Use this option to set the number of pings sent  to
              determine  both the machines on the network and the
              reliability of those machines.   Each  cycle  lasts
              one second.  This option is only useful with the -r
              option.


       -p BYTES

       --psize BYTES

       PACKETSIZE
              These options or a trailing PACKETSIZE on the  com-
              mandline sets the packet size used for probing.  It
              is in bytes inclusive IP and ICMP headers

       -t

       --curses
              Use this option to force  mtr  to  use  the  curses
              based terminal interface (if available).


       -n

       --no-dns
              Use  this option to force mtr to display numeric IP
              numbers and not try to resolve the host names.


       -g

       --gtk
              Use this option to force mtr to use the GTK+  based
              X11  window  interface  (if  available).  GTK+ must
              have been available on  the  system  when  mtr  was
              built  for  this to work.  See the GTK+ web page at
              http://www.gimp.org/gtk/ for more information about
              GTK+.


       -s

       --split
              Use  this  option  to  set mtr to spit out a format
              that is suitable for a split-user interface.


       -l

       --raw
              Use this option to tell mtr to use the  raw  output
              format.  This  format is better suited for archival
              of the measurement results. It could be  parsed  to
              be presented into any of the other display methods.


       -i SECONDS

       --interval SECONDS
              Use this option to specify the positive  number  of
              seconds  between  ICMP  ECHO requests.  The default
              value for this parameter is one second.


BUGS
       Some modern routers give a lower  priority  to  ICMP  ECHO
       packets  than to other network traffic.  Consequently, the
       reliability of these routers reported by mtr will be  sig-
       nificantly  lower  than  the  actual  reliability of these
       routers.
