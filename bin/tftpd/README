This directory contains source code for tftpd, a daemon that implements
the trivial file transfer protocol. Based on the 4.4 BSD tftpd, this
version has been modified to handle client requests in a single
process.

This program is designed for use in environments with lots of bootp
clients. It only allows files to be read by clients listed in
/etc/bootptab.

Please send bugs and comments to tftpd@ee.lbl.gov.
