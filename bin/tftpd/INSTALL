To build tftpd, first customize any paths in Makefile.in, then run
./configure (a shell script).  "configure" will determine your system
attributes and generate an appropriate Makefile from Makefile.in.  Next
run "make", and if everything goes well, su and run "make install".

This software is only known to compile and run under SunOS 4.1.4
and Solaris 5.4. However it should run in other environments
will only minor changes.

For security reasons, this daemon does not allow clients to write or
otherwise modify data on the server.
