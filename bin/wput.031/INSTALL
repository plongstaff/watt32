wput 0.3.1

1) make
2) make install (as root to copy wput into /usr/local/bin) or copy
   wput to any directory you want it to be.

For DOS / Watt-32 users:

  Put the files in a directory under $(WATT_ROOT)/bin.
  To recompile:
  1) Run 'make -f makefile.dj depend'
  2) Run 'make -f makefile.dj'

  Get Watt-32 at http://www.watt-32.net/

  I did this port in hurry, so there may still be bugs.
  The makefile.mw is for MinGW only.
