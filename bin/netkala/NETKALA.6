.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Netkala
Netkala is a game for two players. To my knowledge it comes from
Afrika, where it was played in sand with marbles or Kaori 
shells as pawns (pieces). It is a simple and short game. 
One rather needs to be clever than lucky to win. 
It has a similar character as 'draughts' (American 'checker', 
German 'Dame') or the German kind of 'morris' (called 'Muehle').
The rules of the game are shown further down in this text.
.PP
Both players have to start \fBnetkala\fP with either the
hostname (\fIHOST_NAME\fP) or the host IP (\fIHOST_IP\fP) of
the other player as first argument. 
A socket based connection between the two machines will be
established, and upon success the curses based game dialog will
appear.
.PP
In case you don't know your IP address, use \fBifconfig(8)\fP to 
find it out. 
\fBnslookup(8)\fP might be useful to find the appropriate host 
name for a given IP number.
.PP
If not other specified port 8880 will be used on both ends of
the connection.
In case of troubles, or if one wants to play kalahari on a
single machine between two xterm's, the port number can be
changed by use of the command line option \fB\-r_port\fP or
\fB\-l_port\fP.
It should be clear, that the remote port of one machine/player
(\fB\-r_port\fP) must be set as local port on the other players
machine via \fB\-l_port\fP and vis a versa.
.PP
.B How to play netkala:
.PP
Each player sits in front of a row of five holes (indicated by 
small 'o' and the appropriate color/line style), and has a big 
whole to his right (indicated by capital 'O'):
.PP
            \fBPlayer 1\fP
          \fBo  o  o  o  o\fP
       \fBO\fP                 \fIO\fP
          \fIo  o  o  o  o\fP
            \fIPlayer 2\fP
.PP
At the beginning of the game all the small ('o') holes
are filled with three pieces each. 
The aim of the game is to collect as many pieces in his
big hole.
.PP
An arbitrary player starts (usually the one, that dies earlier). 
He can choose one of his small holes and move. 
He does this by picking all the pieces
of the hole he choose, and distributing them over all the 
following holes. 
.PP
To understand what I mean by \fIfollowing holes\fP
you have to think of all the holes forming an accidently 
flattened circle. 
Moreover we define the direction of the game opposite to the 
direction of conventional clocks (swiss quality clocks).
By \fIdistributing\fP it is meant, that the player leaves exactly 
one piece in each of the following holes. No matter whether its 
his or his opponents whole. 
And no matter whether its a small or a big whole.
.PP
Usually the players play one after each other and nothing
embarrassing will happen. To avoid, that kalahari becomes too
boring, there are three extra rules:
.PP
.IP "\fIRule 1\fP"
If the last piece in a move goes into one of the big side holes
(capital 'O'), the same player plays again.
.IP "\fIRule 2\fP"
If the last piece in a move goes into a small hole, that is
empty, the player can take all pieces from the small hole 
opposite to it, and put them into his big hole 
(no matter, whether the pieces come from one of his, or his 
opponents small holes).
.IP "\fIRule 3\fP"
At the time one of the players hasn't a single piece in one of 
his small holes left, the other player can collect all the pieces
that are left in his small holes and put them into his big hole. 
The number of pieces in the big holes are compared.
The one who was able to collect more wins.
The game is finished.
