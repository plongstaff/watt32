CHANGES for ICMPush v2.2
========================
v2.2:
- Changed the name from ICMP to ICMPush.
- Size of pattern data grow up to 64k (or more on Linuz). Fragmentation made
  by the program itself on Linuz.
- IP_HDRINCL supported. Use only a socket.
- Random sequence number of Information packets.
- Support for Router Advertisement to test routers. Can send multiple
  routers addresses with their own preference on 1 Advertisement packet.
- Cleaned up the code. A parser function with multiple options and a more
  friendly user interface.
- Resolving hosts to names is now optional (-n).
- Changed the compile option -DEBUG to a runtime option (-vv).
- Support for bytes of data garbage to test icmp/ip implementations.
  Option = '-gbg bytes|max'.
- Support for another ICMP error type: Parameter Problem.
- Max code support for the ICMP types that have codes (Redirect, Unreach
  and Time Exceeded). This sends an ICMP code greater than the standard
  codes. Option= '-c max'.
- Numeric codes support for the ICMP types that *DOESN'T* support codes
  (Echo Request, Source Quench, Timestamp Request, Parameter problem,
  Router Advertisement, Router Solicitation, Info Request and Address
  Mask Request). This sends an ICMP packet with the code equal to the
  number parsed from the command line. Option = '-c number'.  
- Finally we have a man page. Thx to wait_man (wait_man@apostols.org)
  and for the english translation to binaria (binaria@totalcoredump.org)
  kisses! :DD.

v2.11:
- GNU GPL license distribution.
- The Router Discovery support has been tested and works ok.
- Support for data pattern into an ECHO REQUEST type. Idea by Sean
  (fa-q@infomind.net). Option = '-pat pattern'.

- Cleared the broadcast setsockopt error.

v2.06:
- Added support for ICMP Address Mask Request, Information Request, Timestamp
  and Router Solicitation (Router Discovery). Can read the replies
  via RAW socket. Can put a timeout replies on command line. (default is
  5 secs).

  support for Router Discovery structures.
