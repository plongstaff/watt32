INSTALL for ICMPush v2.2
========================

Before all, login as root and ...

1.- Compilation:
    Take a look into the Makefile and after:

            make linuz or make solaris

    If you get the message "undefined reference to __inet_aton" you have
    the library that comes with bind 8.1.2.
    To link correctly you must put the complete path to the library
    in the LIBBINDDIR Makefile variable.

2.- Installation:
    By default the program installs itself into /usr/local/bin, you can
    change it with the Makefile variable INST_DIR. The man page installs
    into /usr/local/man/man8, you can change it with the Makefile
    variable MAN_DIR.
    
            make install
    


Byez.
