This is a replacement for syslogd, the system logger. We use it on our 
central logging host but use the stock syslogd on all other hosts with 
a simple "*.*  @loghost" action. 

Perhaps the biggest change over other syslogd implementations is the
configuration file. I borrowed the config file style from the Internet 
Software Consortium's dhcpd and bind. This style is more verbose and
takes up lots of more lines than the "old" syslog.conf style. I really 
like the per-program actions that newer BSD syslogd's have, but I
dislike the config file syntax for them.

Here is a brief list of the "improvements" in this syslogd
implementation.  There are quite a few implementations that do a
number of these "improvements" but not everybody does them all.

  o It removes all of the enforced limitations on the number of
    actions that a lot of commercial syslogd implementations have

  o All of the facilities that I know about are supported: kern user
    mail daemon auth syslog lpr news uucp bsdcron authpriv ftp ntp
    sysvcron local0 local1 local2 local3 local4 local5 local6 local7
    (Note that at least Solaris uses facility 15 for cron and most BSD 
    systems and Linux use facility 9 for cron, so we get two of
    them. Sigh.) 

  o Messages can be logged to files with the facility and priority
    logged. This can be used to log the priority in the "standard"
    numeric form <54> or in a "symbolic" [lpr.info] form.

  o The notify action is no longer supported. I think this is a
    feature, but I'm not sure everybody will agree with me. We use the
    forwarding action with a user space port number.

  o ACL lists can be defined based on domain names ("*.domain.com")
    networks ("127.0.0.0/8" or "128.0.0.1/24") or host names
    ("host.domain.com")

  o Hosts that syslogd will receive messages can be limited to those
    matching an ACL

  o Hosts that syslogd will forward messages for can be limited to
    those matching an ACL

  o The hostname logged for inet messages can be rewritten as a simple 
    host name or as stripping off all or part of a domain name based
    on ACLs. 

  o Actions may be based on the facility, priority, and/or the program 
    name.

  o When forwarding messages to another host you can optionally
    specify the port number and if you wish the hostname from where
    the message was received to be forward too.

  o You can use the "break" action to abort processing of the current
    facility group.

Changes for Watt-32 and djgpp (MSDOS) by Gisle Vanem <giva@bgnett.no>

All changes are inside "#if defined(__WATT32__)" or "#if defined(__DJGPP__)"
This shouldn't hurt for other Unix targets.

Use makefile.dj to compile:
  make -f makefile.dj


Notes: You need GNU Flex if you modify "conf-lex.l".
       You need GNU Bison if you modify "conf-parse.y".
